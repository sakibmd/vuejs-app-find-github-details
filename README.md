## It's a very little vue.js standalone app that I had made for my practicing purpose. 

## You can find anyone's github profile details by using this app.

## ** I did not use vue-cli for this app but used Vue CDN.

Enter a valid github username it shows the github details information of that user. (Ex: sakibmd, lahin31, hasinhayder)
